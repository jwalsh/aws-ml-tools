# ML Tools

## AWSPyML library

This is a set of classes and functions that might be useful in developing
predictive applications with Amazon Machine Learning.  There are utilities
for testing the configuration of a connection to Amazon Machine Learning,
for generating friendly identifiers, and classes for working with Schema
files.  The `guess_schema.py` script relies on this library.
